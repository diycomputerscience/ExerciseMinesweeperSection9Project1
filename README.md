In the previous section, we added functionality for persistence. If you have everything working, you may have noticed that all the labels, menu items, etc are in English. It's a great start, but hey there! we've got global ambitions ! To fulfill them we have to internationalize our software.

In this project you have to [I18N](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) enable the Minesweeper game. For the sake of simplicity, we will support English, and French. Once you understand how to support I18N, you will be able to add support for virtually any other locale. 

Many desktop applications allow users to set the language/locale option from a settings menu. However, once Again for the sake of simplicity, we will use the default locale of the JVM, which is picked up from operating system settings. You may want to take a look at the I18N related dependencies on the Java competencies page at http://diycomputerscience.com/competencies/topic/core-java

<h2>Steps For This Project</h2>

Run ```AllTests``` and verify that 57 tests are run, of which 8 tests fail. You need to make the application I18N enabled, and get all the tests to pass.
